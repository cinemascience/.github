# Cinema Toolkit, v2.0 (October  2021)

The Cinema toolkit has been developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory, as part
of the [Cinema Project](http://cinemascience.org). 

Cinema is an innovative way of capturing, storing and exploring extreme scale
scientific data. It is a highly interactive image-based approach to data
analysis and exploration that promotes investigation of large scientific
datasets, and is easily integrated into your existing workflows through
extensions to widely used open source tools. This novel approach supports
interactive exploration of a wide range of results, while still significantly
reducing data movement and storage.

Extreme scale scientific simulations are leading a charge to exascale
computation, and data analytics runs the risk of being a bottleneck to
scientific discovery. Due to power and I/O constraints, we expect in situ
visualization and analysis will be a critical component of these workflows.
Options for extreme scale data analysis are often presented as a stark
contrast: write large files to disk for interactive, exploratory analysis, or
perform in situ analysis to save detailed data about phenomena that a
scientists knows about in advance. With Cinema, we have developed a novel
framework for a third option â€“ a highly interactive, compact and scalable way
to explore data.

# Cinema Data Specification

The [Current Data Specification](https://github.com/cinemascience/cinema/blob/master/specs/dietrich/01/cinema_specD_v012.pdf) describes the Cinema database data format, which can be easily written and read applications, tools and scripts.
